        <p>
            This website is my personal portfolio where I showcase my
            <span class="highlight">skills, projects, and interests</span>.
            It reflects my journey in web development. Currently it's pretty barebones, but I am sure as time progresses and my skills increase, I would be able to add more content and improve this website. I have added three sections which are about me, contact and portfolio. As noticed, the portfolio section is pretty baren just like my skills in web development.
